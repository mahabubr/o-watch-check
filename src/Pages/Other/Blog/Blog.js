                        Which state management is best in React? React's useState is the best option for local state management. If you need a global state solution, the most popular ones are Redux, MobX, and the built-in Context API. Your choice will depend on the size of your project, your needs, and your engineers' expertise.

                    How does prototypical inheritance work?

                        The Prototypal Inheritance is a feature in javascript used to add methods and properties in objects. It is a method by which an object can inherit the properties and methods of another object. Traditionally, in order to get and set the Prototype of an object, we use Object. getPrototypeOf and Object

                    What is a unit test? Why should we write unit tests?

                <div className="collapse-content">
                    <p>
                        The main objective of unit testing is to isolate written code to test and determine if it works as intended. Unit testing is an important step in the development process, because if done correctly, it can help detect early flaws in code which may be more difficult to find in later testing stages.

                    React vs. Angular vs. Vue?

                        React is a UI library, Angular is a fully-fledged front-end framework, while Vue.js is a progressive framework. They can be used almost interchangeably to build front-end applications, but theyâ€™re not 100 percent the same, so it makes sense to compare them and understand their differences. Each framework is component-based and allows the rapid creation of UI features.
